# Covid-dashboard
My attempt at building a shiny dashboard to track covid-19 cases in Northern new york.

## Introduction
March, 2020 brought the COVID-19 pandemic home to New York State.  In the United States, the New York City metropolitan region has been hardest hit through March and April.  

Because I've been following the outbreak, use R, and want to improve my (very beginner level) shiny skills, I thought I'd try to build a data dashboard about COVID-19 cases in northern New York State.

## Resources
Here are some websites I am using to help build this app.
